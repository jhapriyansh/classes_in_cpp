// Single Inheritance
// One class is derived to another class.
// One Parent / Base Class -> One Child / Derived Class.

// Multiple Inheritance
// Multiple classes are derived to another class.
// Multiple Parent / Base Classes -> Child / Derived Class.

// Hierarchical Inheritance
// One class is derived to multiple classes.
// One Parent / Base Class -> Multiple Child / Derived Classes.

// Multilevel Inheritance
// One class is derived to another class which is then derived to another class.
// One Parent / Base Class -> (Child / Derived Class acts as Parent / Base Class) -> Child Class.

// Hybrid Inheritance
// Combination of multiple, hierarchical and multilevel inheritance.
// Class A -> Class B (from A) and Class C (from A) -> Class D (from B and C).
